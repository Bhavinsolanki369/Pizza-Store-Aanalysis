Suggestions:
1.Pizza, by and large is considered to be a fast food, party food or go to food. General notion suggest that,
  these kind of food sales boost in weekends. But our analysis tells a different story. Our store gets maximum orders on friday.
  That means we need to implement certain strategy to boost weekend orders(saturday and Sunday).
2.Q1(jan,Feb,March) store revenue was $ 205K where as by the end of year in last quarter Q4(Oct,Nov,Dec) it became $ 199K.
